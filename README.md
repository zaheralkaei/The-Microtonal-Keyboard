# The Microtonal Keyboard
A microtonal keyboard with different <abbr>EDO<abbr>s (equal divisions per octave)

This web application is designed to provide a microtonal keyboard interface
with various equal divisions of the octave (<abbr>EDO</abbr>) and drum machine functionality.
It allows users to experiment with different microtonal scales and create rhythms using synthesized drum sounds.
The application is built using the <i>Tone.js library</i> for audio synthesis and manipulation.
